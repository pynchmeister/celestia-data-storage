# celestia-data-storage
Integrating Celestia with a Long-term Data Storage Provider (IPFS, Filecoin, etc.)

## Instructions

Will need to clone either [Rollmint](https://github.com/celestiaorg/rollmint) or [celestia core](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-core/tree/v0.34.x-celestia/docs)

Where exactly does this fit in with the rest of the stack? 

[CIDs](https://github.com/pynchmeister/cid) could be part of the block metadata?
