## Notes / Open Questions

* is using a service such as web3.storage the equivalent of running a "light client" (with the following in mind: ```Filecoin does not use the “full node” or “light client” terminology, in wide use in Bitcoin and other blockchain networks.```)
* How to prove data was posted...verify via [Piece-Inclusion-Proof](https://porcuquine.github.io/specs/docs/proofs/)
* Find the aforementioned Piece Inclusion Proof [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs), should be somewhere in here: https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs/tree/master/storage-proofs-porep 

...here (?) https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs/blob/4ff161d97728fa7ba6e12d519a4c0ce0c1b08096/storage-proofs-porep/src/stacked/circuit/params.rs#L41

* ```web3.storage uses CIDs generated by IPFS, the InterPlanetary File System, to enable content addressing for all data stored in its network — however, just because a file has a CID doesn't mean that the file is guaranteed to be around forever. In a well-operating decentralized system, participants all need to agree to be good actors and provide reliable storage capacity. For this, web3.storage uses the Filecoin network. The Filecoin network and its namesake token FIL (or ⨎ for short) were created to incentivize storage providers on the network to agree to storage deals. These deals specify that a certain amount of storage capacity will be provided over an agreed period of time, ensuring the second part of the solution: content persistence.```

#### Glossary

* [Content Addressing](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/) - ```the technique of issuing each piece of data a content identifier (CID), which is a token derived directly from the file's contents using an algorithm that will always generate the same key for the same content.```
* Proof-of-Replication - ```proves that a given storage provider is storing a unique copy of a client's original data.```
* Proof-of-Spacetime - ```proves that the client's data is stored continuously over time.```
